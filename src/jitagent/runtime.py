"""Call a function that has already been compiled.

The first property (design.md §4.2):

    call_function never hands the caller a result that looks fine but is wrong.

So every call is three steps: **does the input match the schema, run it in the
sandbox, does the return value match the schema**. Both schemas are inferred from the
structure of the examples rather than guessed, and they are the same yardstick
verification used.

**Calling does not write to disk.** This used to count calls, accumulate tokens saved,
quarantine a version after three consecutive failures, and push failing inputs back
into the test set. All of that needs real production traffic to mean anything, and
until it did it made "call a function" a stateful operation with a flush and a session
cache. Calling is now a pure read: no flush, no cache, no fighting between processes.

Batching stays: one `Sandbox.run` takes many inputs and starts one process. 200 calls
one process at a time is 20 seconds; batched it is half a second — and "do it 200
times" is the entire reason this thing exists.
