"""The operations from [design.md §4](../../docs/design.md).

It comes down to three things: **text in, code out, fetch it back by name.**

    compile_function("rank records by score...", examples, name="rank")   -> stored
    get_code("rank")                                                      -> source
    call_function("rank", {"records": [...]})                             -> result

Plus two helpers: `search_functions(query)` to find an existing one, and
`inspect_function(name)` for the details.

There is one step in the middle: `compile_function` **asks the model to write the test
cases out in full first**, then asks it to write the code. The order is deliberate —
see the top of `propose.py`. In one line: when the tests are written the code does not
exist yet, so the code cannot influence them.

**The generation backend is swappable.** `compile_function` only needs an object
satisfying the `LLMClient` protocol (`complete(system=, user=) -> LLMResponse`), so
switching backends means switching this one argument:

    AnthropicClient()    the API directly; needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    ClaudeCliClient()    the local `claude` CLI; no key, uses Claude Code's auth
    ScriptedClient([..]) replays canned replies; for tests, never touches the network

This layer does no work of its own. It orders the steps: `lookup.py` searches,
`synth.py` synthesises, `registry.py` stores, `runtime.py` calls.
